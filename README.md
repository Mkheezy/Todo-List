# Todo-List
A simple To-do list

This To-Do list, is a simple To-Do list with a complicated backgroud. 

This Web app was made using Node.js EJS and Mongo DB with the following dependencies, express, body-parser and lodash.

This web app lets you add and delete items from the to-do list whilst also letting you dynamically create different todo list to suit your different need, simply adding /work will add a work based todo list and /home will add a home based todo list etc. This lets you do as many lists as you want with different headings so that everyone and everything is accomodated.

The web app stores data on mongo db and the hosted version uses mongo atlas, to store, retrieve and delete data. This was used to learn the backend of web development and databases
